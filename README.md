TRUSTED SERVANTS
TTrusted Servants is an advanced, interactive web application designed to assist investigators, analysts, and researchers in detecting and analyzing potential corruption within political and financial networks. By leveraging complex network analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, and interactive visualizations, the system provides a powerful set of tools for uncovering suspicious relationships, transactions, and patterns that may indicate corrupt activities.
Key Features:

Interactive Network Visualization:

The core of the system is a force-directed graph visualization, implemented using D3.js, which displays entities (such as politicians, companies, and organizations) as nodes and their relationships as links.
Nodes are color-coded based on their risk scores, with high-risk entities appearing in red, medium-risk in orange, and low-risk in green.
The size of each node is proportional to its risk score, making it easy to identify high-risk entities at a glance.
Links between nodes are color-coded based on the type of relationship (e.g., financial, ownership, collaboration) and their thickness represents the strength or amount of the connection.
Users can zoom, pan, and drag nodes to explore the network interactively.


Configurable Network Exploration:

Users can adjust the depth of the network exploration (1 to 3 levels deep) to control the complexity of the displayed relationships.
A minimum amount filter allows users to focus on significant financial transactions by filtering out smaller, potentially irrelevant connections.
Relationship type filters enable users to focus on specific types of connections (financial, ownership, collaboration) for targeted analysis.


Search Functionality:

A search bar allows users to find specific entities within the network quickly.
Searched entities are highlighted in the visualization, making them easy to locate within complex networks.


Time-Based Network Analysis:

The system includes a time-based view that shows how the network evolves over time.
This feature helps identify patterns of activity, sudden changes in relationships, or the emergence of new connections that might indicate corrupt activities.


Advanced Network Analytics:

The system calculates and displays various network metrics, including:

Centrality measures (degree, betweenness, eigenvector) to identify key players in the network.
Community detection to uncover clusters of closely related entities.
Average clustering coefficient to measure the tendency of entities to form tightly knit groups.
Network density to assess the overall connectedness of the network.

These analytics help investigators identify influential entities, hidden communities, and unusual network structures that may warrant further investigation.


Risk Scoring:

Each entity in the network is assigned a risk score based on various factors, including their connections, financial activities, and other relevant data.
The risk scoring algorithm helps prioritize which entities or relationships deserve closer scrutiny.


Save and Load Network Views:

Users can save specific network views for later analysis or to share with colleagues.
Saved views can be easily loaded, allowing investigators to resume their work or collaborate on complex cases.


User Authentication and Authorization:

The system includes secure user authentication to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for maintaining secure sessions.


Scalable Backend Architecture:

Built with FastAPI, the backend provides high-performance API endpoints for data retrieval and analysis.
SQLAlchemy is used for efficient database operations and complex queries.
The system is designed to handle large datasets and complex network structures.


Machine Learning Integration:

The backend incorporates machine learning models, such as Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, to assist in identifying unusual patterns or entities within the network.


External Data Integration:

The system is designed to integrate data from various sources, including financial records, public databases, and potentially other intelligence sources.


Responsive Frontend Design:

The React-based frontend is built with responsiveness in mind, allowing investigators to use the system on various devices, from desktop computers to tablets.


Data Privacy and Security:

The system is designed with data protection in mind, ensuring that sensitive information is handled securely throughout the analysis process.
